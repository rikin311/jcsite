	<h2>3 Questions with Razza's Dan Richer</h2>
	<p class="meta">07 Sep 2013</p>

	<div id="post">
		<p>Recently we had the chance to continue our &quot;Three Questions With...&quot; series and talk to Dan Richer, co-founder of Razza with his partner Fred Shandler, located on Grove Street at the old Bar Majestic. Razza is relatively new to the Jersey City scene but has already gained praise as one of the top 33 pizzas in the entire country by Thrillist. </p>

<p>Check out the interview - especially the work that goes into making Razza&#39;s bread and dough. I won&#39;t spoil it but it&#39;s intense. </p>

<h3>Why Jersey City?</h3>

<p>We chose Jersey City for many reasons. Fred, my business partner, and I own a restaurant in Maplewood called Arturo&#39;s Osteria &amp; Pizzeria and we&#39;ve been there for over seven years. Over the past few years, we looked at various towns in NJ from Red Bank to Morristown and everywhere in between. Meanwhile, Fred and I both spent much of our free time in Jersey City eating and drinking with friends at Madame Claude, Marco &amp; Pepe, LITM, Nha Trang, etc. We loved coming here and we wanted to be a part of the community.  We wanted to create a fun and lively restaurant that serves very high quality pizza in a casual and friendly way. </p>

<p>Eventually, we were introduced to Paul and Eric Silverman through mutual friends and we hit it off immediately. They are an amazing group to work with since they truly care about the success of Jersey City neighborhoods. They put lots of time, energy, creativity, and care into developing great places to live and work. Who wouldn&#39;t want to open a restaurant in Jersey City! It&#39;s an amazing place and we&#39;re so happy to be here.</p>

<h3>I&#39;m coming to Razza for the first time, what&#39;s my three course meal going to be?</h3>

<p>First, Bread and Butter. It&#39;s easily my favorite thing we serve. It may seem weird that we charge for our b&amp;b but its truly a dish that warrants it.  </p>

<p>We make our own bread. I&#39;ve been studying bread making and dough fermentation for years now, all in the pursuit of making a great pizza crust.  We use a mix of locally milled wheat from Clifton and locally grown rye from Bucks County, Pennsylvania. It is fermented naturally with the help of our continuously fermenting starter culture that I cultivated from wheat berries grown on a family farm in Hunterdon County. This culture of wild yeast and good bacteria is the essence behind much of what we do at Razza (and at Arturo&#39;s). The bread is baked in our wood fired oven everyday just before dinner service at 4 pm. </p>

<p>The butter is made at Razza as well. We work directly with a farm in Lancaster Valley, PA that provides us with certified organic, grass-fed cow&#39;s cream.This stuff is amazing. Over the course of the year, you can actually taste the seasonal differences in what the cow&#39;s are eating as they switch from grass to hay. After the cream arrives, we culture the butter by introducing Lactobacillus (the good bacteria in yogurt) which lowers the pH and gives it a cheese-like tang. Then we churn the cultured cream into butter and buttermilk. The butter is served at room temperature and the bread is served gently warmed. So, when the two ingredients come together just before you bite into it, they are at the ideal temperature just like a great piece of sushi or like a great latte. Two ingredients coming together to form something better than when separate.</p>

<p>Course number two would have to be whatever salad we are serving as a special that day. It is always completely seasonal and sourced locally from one of the many farms that we work with. We are completely committed using sustainable agricultural products even in the winter. We don&#39;t do this because &quot;farm-to-table&quot; is trendy, we do it because it&#39;s the right way and the only way, for us.</p>

<p>Course number 3 would be a pizza. Any pizza. Like the bread, our dough is really the essence of our pizza. The toppings are much less significant than the pizza as a whole. I view toppings as condiments and are always used in balance, never to overwhelm the crust. You can&#39;t go wrong with any of the pizzas on our menu; it just depends on what you&#39;re in the mood for.</p>

<h3>What is the one thing you wish Jersey City had that it doesn&#39;t already?</h3>

<p>More police officers on the streets. People drive like crazy with no regard for bicyclists or pedestrians and its just dangerous. Lame answer, I know.  JC could use more late night dining options as well.   </p>

<p>Thanks to Dan for answering our questions with such pride &amp; passion for both JC and Razza. If you haven&#39;t tried Razza we hope after reading this you&#39;re tempted to! </p>
